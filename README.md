This open-source program is currently in an very early alpha phase, so pls help us to find bugs in our code and report issues. It's planed for program to have many features that can really help you, its designed like the linux terminal and written in phyton. So when you're using windows, you need to have installed the "phyton 3.12" app or higher from the microsoft store. You probably also can use older versions, but I can't guarantee that the code is working correctly so please install the 3.12 or higher.
